# An Open Source Centrifuge Design for wetlab

## Hi! :) Welcome to the project
We are working on the design of an open hardware centrifuge based on the following questions:
#### What can be improved in existing commercial centrifuges?
#### What can be improved in already existing hardware models?
#### Goal: Design, improve a key feature based on the answers we got from these two questions
#### Design approach:
- Replicate a model of open hardware centrifuges.
- Reverse engineer existing broken commercial centrifuges (fix them is possible as part of the process of learning how they work how, and how they can be improved).
- Propose and develop improvements.
    - Currently there are improvements to be made with regard to cooling and safety.

[Look at the tests-experiments we are working on](/R&D/Hypothesis/)

### Current status of the project:
- [Collected data from users](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zq9jXL4ni4LQY3pLsI8-8exPlcGnMdUV0iULsLTLMks/viewanalytics). This one already points to interesting features to focus on that open hardware solutions don't consider like cooling, or automatic check  of proper balancing.
- [Ordered parts of Polyfuge version](/R&D/Anaylisis/Polyfuge-BOM.yml).

### Current phase: Concept generation and prototype design
Based on the research done about centrifuge usage we have defined [requirements](/R&D/Anaylisis) and target features to focus on.
