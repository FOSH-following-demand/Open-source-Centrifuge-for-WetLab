#TODO: ## Design test cases
 - Design test cases for the DIY centrifuge we are going to buy (Polyfuge) to test its capacity to:
  > Separate microorganisms from media (from the canal water, for example)


#TODO: ## Set target Specs/Hypotheses
 - Specify what is the maximun number of samples slots needed in a normal day in a wet lab.
 - Design for the lowest torque design such that is able to spin at the required speed. For the low volume centrifuge.
 - It does not make sense to build one big machine to be used for both types of volumes.
 > The specs for high volumes are such that the motor holds high torques values, high weight, and high endurance, i.e. long times spinning at constant speed (max 4000 rpm). The mechanism for spinning is more expensive and demanding technically.
 
 > The specs for low volumes are motors able to spin at high speed (max 13 000 rpm), for low weight, and low torque.
