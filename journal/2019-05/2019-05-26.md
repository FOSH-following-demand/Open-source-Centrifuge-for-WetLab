Value proposition scheme

## Jobs ,  role of the user: what are the common actions usually performed when using small and big centrifuges:

- Prepare the samples in the wet lab bench, usually the samples are mounted on a rack where you can use them.
- Then, transfer the samples onto the centrifuge holder/rack.
- Make sure the samples are properly distributed on the centrifuge rack is critical in this process.
  - if these process it is not properly done, users can cause a severe damage to the equipment.
- Close all the lids of the centrifuges and press Run.
- Once is done, open the lids and take away the samples from the centrifuge holder to the bench rack for next use.

## Pains : what bother us as users , and are crtical on the good performance of the above mentioned jobs.
- (**critical**)There is no internal checking from the equipment that tell to the user that the sample are not properly distributed.
- There is no stop mechanism for unbalanced distributions.
- (**critical**)Neither there is any automatic sign from the equipment related with the  closing (at least for small centrifuges) of the respective lids that need to be properly closed, before pressing RUN.
- Even, at least for the case of small centrifuges, the machine is able to start runing even if the lid is not correctly closed.
  - if a lid is not properly closed can lead also to severe damage of the system.
- Consequently, users with no experience can easily break the machine.
- (**Not critical**)The transfer process of samples from the bench rack to the centrifuge and viceversa, could be a bit tedious, specially when working with many samples at once.

## Gains: what we would like to change in order to improve our experience for the above jobs.
