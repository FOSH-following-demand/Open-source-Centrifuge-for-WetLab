## TU Delft meeting 4

- got space to work!
- ordered parts, billing pending to be sent to Andre

- Discussed ideas for testing and put them into issues: cooling, sensing of cooling, secure parts during movement
- design test to be done, mechanical engineer joining project

- Possible outcome for BFOSH: documentation for hw is better if it's kept simple at first (journaling) instead of OPEN ALL in t=0

- Next: get attention to the issues for user input, keep testing and dev

Next meeting: june 21
