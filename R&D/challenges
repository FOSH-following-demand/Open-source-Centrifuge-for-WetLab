#Partial Challenges
In the further development of the centrifuge we can identify a set of smaller challenges that anyone can take up.

### New Motor
(insert motor specs en technical drawings from both motors)
1. Design how the bigger motor can be fastened to the frame.
2. Design a new rotor that can be fastened to the new motor.
3. Incorporate the electronics of the new motor in current electronics layout.
4. Incorporate the control of the new motor in the code.

### Safety
1. Design a safety lid with metal sheet that can absorb a sample that is flung out.
2. Design a safety system that switches of the motor when the rotor is imbalanced.
3. Design a braking systems that does not only switch of the motor but also actively stops it.
4. Design a rotor with an extra safety lid that keeps the samples in place while spinning.

### Cooling
1. Simulate cooling of the air volume under the lid with the Peltier element (insert specs). How long does it take to cool 20 C to 4 C?
2. Design a controlling system for the cooling with the Peltier ellement.
3. Design other ways to cool the air under the lid or just the samples alone.

### Customization
1. Design a fully 3D printable design of the frame.
2. Create a parametric model that can create custom laser cut files based on the current design.
3. Create a parametric model that can create custom 3D print files based on the design of (1).
