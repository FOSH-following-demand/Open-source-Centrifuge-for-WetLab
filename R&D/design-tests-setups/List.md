In this document we collect all the hypothesis related to product improvements, pains and gains from our analysis. This analysis includes the state of the art of current open hardware and proprietary centrifuges, as wel.

#Hypothesis:30 ## Doubled motor centrifuge
A model like the one in the drawing can be more cost effective...


#TEST:50 Calculate costs for doubled motr centrifuge
Assuming the following


#Hypothesis:0 ## An industrial standard casing that can be adapted re-purposed
- There might be casings, and chasis solutions that are generic and can be used for the centrifuge.

#Hypothesis:20 ## Casing made of [vacuum forming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_forming)
- We can make already an improvement to this centrifuge by changing the casing design.
