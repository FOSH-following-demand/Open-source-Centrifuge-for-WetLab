## 1. Concept-for-solution:
We can replicate with fairly simple, off the sheleve components the existing solution.

## 2. To verify that we will do the following test:
Open it and set he design. Reverse engineering.


## 3. What are you going to measure
How it is implement.

## 4. Your experiment is successful if:
we can replicate quite exactly the same results with our DYI, or version.
