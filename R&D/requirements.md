#Requirements

####Samples
  - 'x' number of samples
  - sample volume range 'x' to 'z'
  - sample tubed spin under 'z' angle
  - Must be able to keep samples symetric in rotor

####motor
  - 'X' RPM
  - 'z' torque
  - Reliable motor speed with dynamic load variations (is there any specification for this?)

####Interface / Software
  - Be able to change speed (per how much RPM?)
  - Be able to change run time (per s ?)
  - Show current speed and time on screen

####Safety
  - Samples must be fixed to rotor
  - The spinning rotor is covered
  - The rotor can't spin while uncovered, can't be uncovered while spinning -> some kind of electric lock needed.
  - Noise limit should be limited to 'x' dB --> limit friction on moving parts.
  - Wiring and small components can't be exposed to moving parts.

####Embodiment
  - Easy to clean from microbe contamination --> smooth surface, no ridges.
  - Vibration resistant fasteners
  - footing should be stable on a tabletop.
  - Dampening of tremble from rotation is required  --> a counter weight at the bottom?

####Construction
  - Be able to be put together locally like a kit (is this a requirement?)
  - Be able to be taken apart locally for repair
