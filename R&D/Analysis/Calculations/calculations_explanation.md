Centrifugation is a sedimentation technique, accelerated thanks to the use of centrifugal force.
It is applied to the analysis or separation of mixtures of particles, cells, organelles or molecules.

### Instrumental
1. Tubes

  - Made of glass or plastic.
  -  Resistant chemically (solvents, reactants) and physically (tension at the high speeds used).
  - Different sizes and shapes.
  - Special plastics for high speeds.

### Modalities
#### According to the speed:

 Approximate criterion:

- Centrifuging at low speed less than 10,000 rpm
- Centrifugation at high speed between 10,000 and 20,000 rpm
- Ultracentrifugation more than 20,000 rpM

#### According to the purpose:
1. Analytical centrifugation
    - Objective: to measure the physical properties of the sedimenting particles, such as their sedimentation coefficient or their molecular mass. Especially in the analytical ultracentrifugation variant.
    -  The molecules are observed by an optical system during centrifugation. The centrifuge tubes must be made of quartz to allow visible and ultraviolet light to pass through. Tilting rotor, vertical observation.


2.  Preparative centrifugation

      - Most commonly used.
      - Objective: to isolate particles, cells or molecules for analysis or later use.
      - In general, a greater amount of sample is used than in the analytical one.

#### According to the medium in which it is centrifuged and the way in which the sample is applied:

1.  Differential centrifugation
    (Also called mobile border).
      - The tube is filled with sample and centrifuged.
      - The behavior of each component of the sample depends on its shape, size, density and, logically, the centrifugation conditions.
      -  Only 2 fractions are obtained: sediment and supernatant.

       - **Note**: the word precipitate is more suitable for something insoluble, which precipitates by centrifugation or by other mechanisms (eg, a chemical reaction); sediment is more correct for what has been forced to go to the bottom but it would still be soluble; pellet is an English word for what remains compacted in the background as a consequence of centrifugation
       - A typical application is subcellular fractionation (separation of the different components of a cell, mainly from organelles) (see Luque or Alberts) using successive centrifugations at increasing speed.

### Zonal centrifugation or sedimentation velocity
- The sample is applied in a thin layer on the centrifugation medium, which is a density gradient.
- Under centrifugal force, the particles settle through the gradient, concentrating on discrete zones or bands. Its speed of advance (and, therefore, the mechanism of separation) depends on its size, shape and density; all these parameters are combined in the sedimentation coefficient.


- The centrifugation must end before any of the separated particles reaches the bottom of the tube.
-  The separate components are collected individually by carefully aspirating the different bands or, better, drilling the bottom of the tube and collecting in fractions the liquid that falls.

An animation of the separation can be seen [here :)](http://biomodel.uah.es/biomodel-misc/anim/centrif/sep-grad.htm).

- The density gradient is created by a concentration gradient: increasing concentrations, when lowering in the tube, of a suitable component.
- They are used sucrose, cesium chloride, albumin, fetal bovine serum, etc.

It can be prepared:

1. a discontinuous or graduated gradient, manually
2. a continuous gradient, using a gradient forming device
3. a continuous self-forming gradient, if created by centrifugation, usually at the same time as the sample is fractionated



### Isopycnic or equilibrium sedimentation centrifugation
1. A density gradient is also used, but in this case the centrifugation time is long enough (up to 1 or 2 days) for the sedimentation balance to be reached (between the centrifugal force, the hydrostatic thrust of the cell and its diffusion).
2. To achieve this, continuous gradients are used that cover the entire density range of the sample components: at the bottom of the tube, the density of the medium must be greater than that of the densest component.
3.  In this way, regardless of the centrifugation time, the particles, cells, etc. they will never sediment in the bottom, but reach a stable intermediate position in the gradient, where they are concentrated in a very narrow band (better resolution).
4.   The most frequent thing is to mix the sample with the material that will form the gradient and generate a self-forming gradient at the same time that the separation is made. It requires very high speeds (ultracentrifugation) for the gradient to form.

In addition to the higher resolution, the interesting thing about this technique is that it separates exclusively according to the density of the components of the sample, which are located in the position of the gradient where the density of the medium is equal to its own (isopycnical = of equal density , in Greek).


### Barrier methods
1. Separation of leukocytes and erythrocytes over a bed of constant density.
2.  A rapid method, typical for example in obtaining blood leukocytes circulating freely from the rest of blood cells.
3.  It is a centrifugation through a medium of constant density (it could be considered as a step gradient of a single stage). The density of this bed must be intermediate between that of the cell types that are to be separated.
4.   Commercial media such as Ficoll-Paque, Lymphoprep and many others are used, generally formed by mixtures of Ficoll (a synthetic polysaccharide) and metrizamide (an iodinated synthetic compound).
5.   Several media are available with densities suitable for the separation of specific cell types; for example, Nycoprep 1.077 for mononuclear cells, Nycoprep 1.068 for monocytes, Polymorhoprep for polymorphonuclear cells, or Nycoprep 1.063 for platelets.

### Calculations


Conversion of speed of rotation (revolutions per minute, rpm) to centrifugal acceleration (relative centrifugal force, FCR, without units):

The same separation will be achieved in 2 different centrifuges when FCR is equal, not if the speed of rotation (rpm) is the same. It is important, therefore, to give the conditions of centrifugation in FCR, not in rpm.

The FCR is what is colloquially called "number of ges", because it is measured using the acceleration of gravity as a unit, g. It is thus expressed, eg, "a centrifugation of 15 min at 20,000 g" (or "at 20,000 × g").

The relationship between the two depends on the radius of the rotor (measured from the axis of rotation to the position of the sample in the tube) as follows:

The separation by centrifugation depends on the cell mass (m), the radius of gyration of the tube -or radius of the rotor- where the sample (r) is placed and the speed reached by the centrifuge (ω or n):

    Fc = m⋅a = m⋅v2r = m⋅e2r⋅t2 = m⋅φ2⋅r2r⋅t2 = m⋅φ2⋅rt2 = m⋅ω2⋅r =
    m⋅ (2π) 2⋅n^2⋅r = 39,48⋅m⋅n^2⋅r
Being:

    Fc = centrifugal force
    m = mass of the cell
    a = v^2/r = acceleration; if it's about sediment to unit gravity  a=g= 9,8 m/s^2 = 980 cm/s^2
    v = et = linear velocity of the sample in the tube (cm / min)
    r = turning radius, measured between the midpoint of the centrifuge tube and the axis of rotation (cm)
    e = linear space traveled, if the movement were linear (cm)
    t = sedimentation time used when centrifuging (min)
    φ = angle traveled in the rotation movement (radians = angle whose arc is equal to r); φ = er
    ω = φt = angular velocity, since the movement is of rotation (rad / min = min-1)
    n = speed of rotation (revolutions per second = rps, or revolutions per minute = rpm); ω = 2π n

Now the Relative centrifugal force, is determined by the relation:

      RCF=F_c/Fg= 39,48⋅m⋅n^2⋅r/m*980 cm s^2=0,0403⋅n^2⋅r cm−1⋅s^2

Lets separate the units speed in rpm  and r in cm: (Look at the latex equations)

       FCR=n^2⋅r/89365

LATEX EQUATIONS

    \begin{equation*}
    F_c=ma
    =\frac{m v^2}{r}=\frac{m e^2}{r t^2}=\frac{m \phi^2 r^2}{r t^2} =\frac{m \phi^2 r}{t^2}= m \omega^2 r= m (2\pi)^2 n^2 r=39,48 m n^2 r
    \end{equation*}

    \begin{equation*}
        FCR=\frac{F_c}{F_g}=\frac{a}{g}=\frac{39,48 n^2 r}{980}=0,0403 n^2 r  \si{cm^{-1}. s^2}
    \end{equation*}

    FCR=0,0403\left(\left( \frac{n^2}{rpm^2}\right) \frac{1}{3600s^2}\right) \left( \frac{r}{cm}\right) cm cm^{-1}s^2 = 11,19 * 10^{-6} \left(\frac{n}{rpm}\right)^2 \left(\frac{r}{cm}\right)


### k-factor

The most important contributors to rotor efficiency are
the maximum speed, maximum radius (rmax), and minimum
radius (rmin)—all of which contribute to the maximum
g-force generated by the rotor. Firstly, the greater the
minimum radius, the greater the centrifugal force at the
top of the tube, and the faster the separation will proceed.
Furthermore, the centrifugal force at the rmin defines
the minimum size of a particle to start sedimentation.
Another factor that has a direct bearing on rotor efficiency
is the total pathlength of the rotor, or the difference
between maximum and minimum radius. Shorter
pathlengths mean particles have less distance to travel
before pelleting against the tube wall. Pathlengths in similar
rotors are a function of the diameter of the sample tube
and the angle at which the tube is held. A more sharply
angled tube generally results in a shorter pathlength.
A simple measure of overall rotor efficiency that takes
into consideration these variables is the k-factor, where:


    k= 2.533 x 10^5 x ln(r_max/r_min)/(RPM/1000)^2

A lower k factor corresponds to a more efficient rotor.

#### Comparative Efficiencies of Two 70,000 rpm Rotors

Applying the aforementioned efficiency factors to runs
of the Beckman Coulter Type 70.1 Ti and Type 70 Ti
rotors yield interesting results. The following example
demonstrates how the Type 70.1 Ti at 450,000 x g will
actually pellet material faster than a Type 70 Ti at a
higher RCF (504,000 x g) when both are run at the
same rotations per minute (70,000 rpm). As you can
see in Table 1, the geometry of the tube cavity for the
Type 70.1 Ti serves to decrease the maximum radius
of the rotor (leading to a lower g-force) but also decreases
the pathlength of the particles within the sample tube.
The net effect of this reduced pathlength is a more
favorable k-factor for the Type 70.1 Ti (right plot in the figure), resulting in more than 18% faster pelleting time than in the Type 70 Ti (left plot in the figure) .

Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) is a common protein in
research utilized for a multitude of purposes with a
sedimentation coefficient (s) of 4.4s. Using the previous
k-factors calculated for those rotors, for example, if an
experimenter desired to pellet BSA using a Type 70 Ti
rotor, the pelleting time can be calculated as such,
where t is the run time in hours required to pellet particles
of known sedimentation coefficient (in Svedberg units, s):

    t=k/s , k=k-factor , s=sedimentation coefficient

This simple calculation helps researchers save valuable
time, and spin for the most efficient duration.
