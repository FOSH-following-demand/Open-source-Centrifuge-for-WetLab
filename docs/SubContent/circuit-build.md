## Voltage regulator for board
The board takes a maximum of 5.5 Volts, there fore a voltage regulator is needed. We are currently using a [LM2596 Voltage Regulator](https://www.minikits.com.au/LM2596-PSU-01).

## Troubleshooting and issues
### Bad USB connection with arduino NANO due to USB mini por:
Arduino Nano presents a lot of instability with regard to USB mini jack.
In many cases it doesn't allow to upload
