# Contributing guidelines
## Hi! ðŸ˜¸ Thank you very much for reaching us out.
We are looking for contributions of different kind that ranges from incidental but meaningful contributions to extended and close collaboration.

## Things to consider:
- We are focusing in this first iteration on small centrifuge design of 15 ml.
- We are using a reference open hardware project to replicate, test, hack and improve if possible.
-

## These is a list of things you can do in order to contribute to the project:
### User feedback:
- If you are a user of this equipment you can (https:[fill in this form]//docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScyTZIfLe0GmoX6rdi7wdyzSNGVoP2hBOGGEqeAVn0CZmRDTQ/viewform) and share it with your colleagues.

### Opening github issues for design improvements you have been thinking about:
We always consider each improvement as a hypothesis that needs to be tested.
You can also point to videos, documentation and solutions that support the hypothesis/idea you have in mind. [See this example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cuh2msd2lo) as a style guide for test setup.
- If you have ideas about centrifuge solutions features, open an issue and describe the concept/hypothesis considering the following:
  1. How this feature improves the centrifuge design considering:
  1.1. Pains you have already had in your previous experience.
  1.2. Gains your idea has.

  2. Description of the concept.
  3. Preferably describe a test case/experiment [by using the following  markdown template](https://github.com/FOSH-following-demand/Open-source-Centrifuge-for-WetLab/blob/master/R%26D/test-cards/README.md).
  - [You can find an example here:](https://github.com/FOSH-following-demand/Open-source-Centrifuge-for-WetLab/blob/master/R%26D/test-cards/Cooling-led-2.md)
